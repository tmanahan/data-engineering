Data Engineering Application for Ted Manahan

Setup and Run Notes:
* Developed with ruby 1.8.7, rails 2.3.15, rake 0.8.7, MySQL 5.5.17 (our production environment)
* My development OS is Windows XP; the application should run on any OS
* Create the tables with db/create.sql: 'mysql -uroot -p ls_development < db/create.sql'
* Edit config/database.yml and db/schema.rb as needed for your database password
* Simple test have been developed; run with 'rake test' (requires db password in db/create.sql)
* Run mongrel web server with 'ruby script/console -p <<port>>'
* Access the main menu by going to the root of your server. You can upload a
  data file, then return to the main menu to view merchants, items, and sales.

Data Modeling Notes
* Three tables are required to normalize the input file
  - merchants: identified by name, no foreign key
  - items: identified by description and merchant_id, foreign key = merchant_id
  - sales: not uniquely identified, foreign key = item_id
* Uploading the same data file multiple times results in new sales records. Merchants
  and items records are reused based on the identifiers listed above.

Other notes:
* For a production system the loader should put sale_records.upload_action in
  a transaction, aborting if any line is invalid
* There is still some 'lint' in the code. The main example is that the 'create'
  and 'new' functions in the controllers are not accessible from the GUI.
